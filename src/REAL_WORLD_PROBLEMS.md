## Interconnected Impact

These problems don't exist in isolation. Solving one often helps others:

```
Climate Change ──► Poverty ──► Food Insecurity
      │              │              │
      ▼              ▼              ▼
   Health ◄─── Migration ◄─── Conflict
      │              │              │
      ▼              ▼              ▼
 Education ──► Employment ──► Inequality
```

**Example**: Funding girls' education (#16) reduces:
- Poverty (#2) — Each year of schooling = 10% income increase
- Population growth (#11) — Educated women have fewer children
- Child mortality (#31) — Educated mothers = healthier children
- Climate impact (#1) — Education correlates with environmental awareness

---

## Call to Action
