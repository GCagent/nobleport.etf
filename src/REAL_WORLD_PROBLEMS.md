## Health & Wellbeing

### 9. Mental Health Crisis
1 billion people live with mental health conditions. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. We need accessible, affordable mental healthcare and destigmatization.

### 10. Pandemic Preparedness
COVID-19 exposed critical vulnerabilities. Future pandemics are inevitable. We need global surveillance systems, rapid vaccine development, and equitable distribution infrastructure.

### 11. Antibiotic Resistance
700,000 die annually from drug-resistant infections—projected to reach 10 million by 2050. New antibiotics and antimicrobial stewardship are critical.

### 12. Healthcare Access
Half the world lacks access to essential health services. 100 million are pushed into extreme poverty by healthcare costs. Universal healthcare models need scaling.

### 13. Chronic Disease Epidemic
Non-communicable diseases (heart disease, diabetes, cancer) cause 71% of deaths globally. Prevention, early detection, and lifestyle interventions are essential.

### 14. Maternal & Child Mortality
295,000 women die during pregnancy/childbirth annually. 5 million children under 5 die yearly, mostly from preventable causes. Basic healthcare access would save millions.

### 15. Addiction & Substance Abuse
Opioid crisis, alcoholism, and addiction affect hundreds of millions. We need harm reduction, treatment access, and addressing root causes of despair.

### 16. Aging Population
By 2050, 2.1 billion people will be over 60. Healthcare systems, eldercare, and retirement infrastructure are unprepared for this demographic shift.

## Economic & Social

### 17. Wealth Inequality
The richest 1% own more than the bottom 50% combined. Wealth concentration undermines democracy, social mobility, and economic stability.

### 18. Global Poverty
700 million people live in extreme poverty (<$2.15/day). 3.4 billion struggle to meet basic needs. Economic opportunity and social safety nets need expansion.

### 19. Housing Affordability
1.6 billion people lack adequate housing. Urban housing costs outpace wages globally. Innovative construction, zoning reform, and financing solutions are needed.

### 20. Food Insecurity
828 million people face chronic hunger while 1/3 of food is wasted. We need efficient food systems, reduced waste, and equitable distribution.

### 21. Unemployment & Underemployment
200 million unemployed globally, with billions more in precarious work. Automation threatens more jobs. We need reskilling, safety nets, and new work models.

### 22. Financial Exclusion
1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. Billions more lack access to credit, insurance, and investment. Fintech and blockchain can democratize financial services.

### 23. Gender Inequality
Women earn 20% less than men globally. 2.4 billion women lack equal economic rights. Education, equal pay, and leadership opportunities need advancement.

### 24. Racial & Ethnic Discrimination
Systemic racism persists in healthcare, education, criminal justice, and economic opportunity across nations. Structural reforms and accountability are essential.

## Governance & Rights

### 25. Corruption
$2.6 trillion lost to corruption annually—5% of global GDP. It undermines development, justice, and public trust. Transparency and accountability systems are needed.

### 26. Democratic Backsliding
Freedom has declined globally for 18 consecutive years. Authoritarianism, misinformation, and polarization threaten democratic institutions.

### 27. Refugee Crisis
100+ million forcibly displaced people worldwide—the highest in history. We need humane policies, integration support, and addressing root causes.

### 28. Human Rights Violations
Billions live under regimes that suppress speech, assembly, and basic rights. International accountability mechanisms need strengthening.

### 29. Criminal Justice Reform
Mass incarceration, especially in the US, destroys families and communities. Rehabilitation over punishment, and addressing systemic bias, are needed.

### 30. Child Labor & Exploitation
160 million children in child labor, 25 million in forced labor. Ending exploitation requires economic alternatives and enforcement.

### 31. Human Trafficking
25 million people trapped in modern slavery. Trafficking generates $150 billion annually. Detection, prosecution, and victim support need scaling.

### 32. Press Freedom
Journalists face violence, imprisonment, and murder. Misinformation spreads while trustworthy journalism struggles financially.

## Technology & Society

### 33. Digital Divide
2.7 billion people lack internet access. The gap between connected and disconnected populations widens economic inequality.

### 34. Privacy Erosion
Mass surveillance by governments and corporations threatens individual autonomy. Data protection and encryption need strengthening.

### 35. AI Safety & Ethics
AI systems can perpetuate bias, enable surveillance, and threaten jobs. Responsible AI development and governance frameworks are urgent.

### 36. Cybersecurity Threats
Cyberattacks cost $8 trillion globally in 2023. Critical infrastructure, healthcare, and democratic systems are vulnerable.
