## External Documents Requiring Review

### 1. Tokenomics PDF (Dated September 28, 2025)

**Flagged Issues:**
- [ ] "December 20, 2025 public sale" — Update to March 5, 2026 private placement
- [ ] "$1.00 public sale" pricing — Revise to "$1.00 private placement offering price"
- [ ] "DEX/CEX listings" at launch — Clarify secondary market restrictions

**Required Language:**
- All token offerings are private placements under Reg D 506(b)

- No general solicitation or public advertising

### 2. Real Brokerage Handshake Document
