## 🔐 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) & ENS Integration

NoblePort ETF leverages Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles through ENS-based Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to provide cryptographic identity verification for all ecosystem participants.

### ENS DID Architecture

```
NoblePort SSI Layer
├── Identity Resolution
│   ├── did:ens:nobleport.eth (Root Identity)
│   ├── did:ens:etf.nobleport.eth (ETF Identity)
│   └── Subname DIDs for properties/participants
│
├── Resolution Stack
│   ├── did-resolver (Universal DID resolution)
│   ├── ens-did-resolver (ENS-specific resolver)
│   └── ethers.js (Ethereum provider)
│
└── Verification Layer
    ├── DID Documents
    ├── Verification Methods
    └── Service Endpoints
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install ENS DID resolver dependencies
npm install ens-did-resolver did-resolver ethers
```

### Usage

**Resolve NoblePort Root DID:**

```typescript
import { resolveEnsDid, NOBLEPORT_ENS } from './src/lib/ensDidResolver';

// Resolve the NoblePort root DID
const didDocument = await resolveEnsDid('did:ens:nobleport.eth');
console.log(didDocument.verificationMethod);
```

**Resolve ENS Address:**

```typescript
import { resolveEnsAddress } from './src/lib/ensDidResolver';

// Get Ethereum address for ENS name
const address = await resolveEnsAddress('nobleport.eth');
// Returns '0x...' or null
```

**Get ENS Text Records:**

```typescript
import { getEnsTextRecords } from './src/lib/ensDidResolver';

// Fetch text records
const records = await getEnsTextRecords('nobleport.eth', [
  'url',
  'email',
  'description',
  'com.twitter',
  'com.github',
]);
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your Ethereum provider credentials:

```bash
# .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=your_infura_project_id
# Or use Alchemy
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY=your_alchemy_key
```

### SSI Dashboard

The NoblePort SSI Architecture dashboard (`src/components/NoblePortSSIArchitecture.tsx`) provides:

- **Identity Resolution**: Resolve any ENS name to its DID Document
- **Address Lookup**: View associated Ethereum addresses
- **Text Records**: Display ENS profile information

### DID Document Structure

A resolved `did:ens:nobleport.eth` returns a DID Document containing:

```json
{
  "id": "did:ens:nobleport.eth",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:ens:nobleport.eth#controller",
